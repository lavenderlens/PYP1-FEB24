Exception handling
_________________

Exception: an error, some exceptional situation, something taht causes the interpreter to crash
Compilation error: syntax error in code
Logic errors: syntactically correct code that doesn't work as expected
These are NOT candidates for exception handling
Custom exceptions: we may "raise" these at point sin our code to distinguish from system generated ones
In a stack trace we will see our own CustomException class name
Where do we handle exceptions?
If an exception is not handled in its module it is passed to main to handleIf it is not handled in main the only place for it to be passed to is the interpreter
