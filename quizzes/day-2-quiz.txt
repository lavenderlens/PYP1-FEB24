Day 2 Quiz
----------
1. In function parameters,
*args packs n number of positional arguments into a _____tuple ? 
**kwargs packs n number of named arguments into a _____dict ?

2. Which function is pure, a or b?
b

// even if this were declared
thing = ''
// any changes to this would change output of a

def a():
    print(thing)

def b(thing):
    print(thing)

3. Which function has a closure?

def outer_a():
    lst = []
    def add_to_lst(item):
        nonlocal lst
        return_value = lst
        lst.append(item)
        return return_value
    return add_to_lst

def outer_b():
    lst = []
    def add_to_lst(item):
        global lst
        return_value = lst
        lst.append(item)
        return return_value
    return add_to_lst

// if referring to a globale variable,
its value is accessible from the global namespace
by ANY function
so, if function b above has a dependency on global lst
its output may change unpredictably
on the other hand, function a has a lexically-scoped variable
this is ONLY visible inside the function
its inner function captures a reference to this inner lst
and retains that reference through successive calls
so a is a closure
